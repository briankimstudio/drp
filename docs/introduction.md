Drud response prediction is a research area where gene level information is examined to predict the effectiveness of a given anti-cancer drug on cancer.

## Purpose

To identify effective anti-cancer drugs for patients by examining each patient's unique gene level information using machine learning algorithm.

## Research methods

Drug response dataset contains gene level information such as gene expression and the results of drug response. For example, the drug 1 is effective for the sample 1's gene expression, but, not effective for sample 2's gene expression. In other words, we can tell the association between gene level information and drug's effectiveness. Once we figure that out, we would compare patient's gene level information with the dataset to determine whether the given drugs would helpful for the given patient or not.

## Results

The results is trained machine learning model. It take patient's gene information as an input, then, predict whether the drug is effective or not for this patient.
