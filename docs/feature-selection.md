In drug response prediction dataset, rows indicate samples and columns represent genes. Thus, number of features equals the number of genes. Unfortunately, the number of genes easily exceeds 10,000. This high dimensionality of dataset requires feature selection process to reduce dimensionalty. There are several approaches in dimension reduction. 

- t-test
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
