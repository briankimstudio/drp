In this section, we are going to apply machine learning technique to the data. Drug response prediction is a binary classification problem. Therefore, any binary classifier could be used for this purpose.

### 1. Logistic Ridge Regression

Among various types of regression methods, logistic regression generates binary output. Moreover, in order to reduce overfitting, the Ridge L2 regulation is used.

### 2. Deep Neural Network (DNN)
